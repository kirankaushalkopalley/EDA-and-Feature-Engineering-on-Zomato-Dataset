## General Points for EDA and Feature Engineering

1. **Data Summary:**
   - Generate descriptive statistics for numeric columns.
   - Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

2. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Explore the distribution of each variable.
   - Utilize histograms, kernel density plots, and summary statistics.

3. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Analyze relationships between pairs of variables.
   - Use scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots.

4. **Categorical Variable Analysis:**
   - Explore the distribution of categorical variables.
   - Utilize bar charts, pie charts, and count plots.

5. **Numeric Variable Analysis:**
   - Analyze the distribution of numeric variables.
   - Use box plots, violin plots, and statistical measures.

6. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Handle categorical variables by encoding or creating dummy variables.
   - Create new features that may enhance predictive modeling.
   - Explore interactions between variables.

7. **Target Variable Analysis:**
   - If applicable, analyze the distribution of the target variable.
   - Explore relationships between predictors and the target.

8. **Visualization:**
   - Use visualizations to convey insights effectively.
   - Utilize matplotlib, seaborn, or other plotting libraries.

9. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear and concise documentation for each step.
   - Explain any transformations or manipulations applied to the data.
